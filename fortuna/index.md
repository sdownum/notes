# Fortuna Notes

## Ideas
* Show an implementation of a simple terminal-based game
* The general idea is a rogue-like sci-fi game
* See how this can be built using the Arduino IDE
* Show how this can be played over a serial console of the Intel Galileo
* Show how this can be played using a telnet session to the Galileo
* Bonus: Make a UEFI Shell implementation of it, that lets the Galileo 
	boot directly into the game from them MicroSD card.

## Ideas

* Investigate any attempts to get the Minnowboard to be Arduino compatible
* Investigate any documentation on creating and distributing Arduino libraries.
* Make a web server Arduino library and use it to create Web apps with the Arduino IDE
* Investigate more into C10M problem.
* Investigate how close to the hardware Arduino sketches can realistically go on the Galileo

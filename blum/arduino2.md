## Your Friend: The Breadboard
1. Where to begin to prototype a circuit
2. Vertical rails provide ground and power
3. Horizontal rails are good for mounting integrated circuits (ICs)


## Resistors
1. This project use a 220 Ohm resistor to protect the LEDs.
2. A 10K Ohm resistor is used as a pull down for the button.
3. Look up how to read the color-coded resistor codes on google

## LEDs
1. Are directional, so pin order matters.
2. Some have indicators, such as lead length

## Push button
1.
